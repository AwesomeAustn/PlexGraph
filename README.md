# PlexGraph

PlexGraph is a quick-n-dirty script that can chart your Plex libraries based on various criteria (year, content rating, genre, etc). It won't win any UI awards, but can quickly give you a nice visualization of your library.

Originally created in repl.it, but moving it here for better tracking in case I ever decide to do more with it.

# My Notes:
It doesn't work in Firefox. It loads, but the 'Load Libraries' button doesn't do anything. It works in Microsoft Edge. I don't use Google Chrome, so I don't know if it works or not.
