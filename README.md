# PlexGraph

PlexGraph is a quick-n-dirty script that can chart your Plex libraries based on various criteria (year, content rating, genre, etc). It won't win any UI awards, but can quickly give you a nice visualization of your library.

Originally created in repl.it, but moving it here for better tracking in case I ever decide to do more with it.
